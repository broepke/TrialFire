## What is a Marketing Attribution Platform?

a Marketing Attribution Platform is a tool that allows you to track the effectiveness of your marketing campaigns. It does this by tracking the user's journey from the first time they visit your site to the point of conversion. 

[Trialfire](https://trialfire.com) is a Marketing Attribution Platform with a couple of huge advantages. Not only does it make it easy to instrument your site with a point-and-click interface, but the data is also organized so that it's incredibly clean and easy to build Machine Learning models. In many cases, all the features you would need to create are already available, and it even has binary classification targets pre-built into the data. In this article, I'll show you how to leverage Trialfire to build a model that predicts which users will convert to paid.

## Motivation

This article will focus less on the fundamentals of model building and more on the **overall methodology** in setting up the **end-to-end process** for moving this into production. There will be references to best practices throughout as needed.

I am going to break this down into three steps:

* **Step 1**: Creating Production-Ready Queries for Our Model
* **Step 2**: Model Building with XGBoost
* **Step 3**: Inferencing on Fresh Data

In each of these steps, I'll explain the thought process and logic behind the steps. 

Let's go!
